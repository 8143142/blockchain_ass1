Adding a Transaction:

Purpose: The primary purpose of adding a transaction is to record a transfer of value from one participant to another within the blockchain network. Transactions typically include details such as the sender's address, recipient's address, the amount of value being transferred, and any additional data.
Process: Participants submit transactions to the network, and these transactions are collected in a pool of unconfirmed transactions. Miners or validators then select transactions from this pool to include in the next block. The selection criteria may vary, but it often involves prioritizing transactions with higher fees or gas.
Outcome: Once a transaction is included in a block and that block is successfully mined, the transaction is considered confirmed and added to the blockchain. The state of account balances is updated accordingly.

Mining a Block:

Purpose: Mining a block is the process by which new blocks are added to the blockchain. This process is essential for securing the network, reaching consensus, and ensuring the immutability of the blockchain. Mining also introduces new cryptocurrency into circulation as a reward for the miner's efforts.
Process: Miners gather a set of valid transactions from the pool and compete to solve a cryptographic puzzle (proof-of-work). The first miner to solve the puzzle gets the right to add a new block to the blockchain. This process requires computational effort and ensures that adding a block is resource-intensive, making it difficult for malicious actors to control the blockchain.
Outcome: Successfully mining a block results in the creation of a new block containing a set of transactions. The new block is appended to the existing blockchain, and the miner is rewarded with newly created cryptocurrency (e.g., mining reward and transaction fees).
In summary, adding a transaction is the process of submitting and confirming individual transactions, while mining a block involves the creation of new blocks containing a set of confirmed transactions. Both processes are integral to the functionality and security of a blockchain network.
